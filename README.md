Country name should be sent in ISO Alpha-2 format (like RU, EU, DE, FR etc.). You can check the full list in /public directory.

Here's an example of GET query request, that should be sent to http://HOST/getflag

    {
        country: RU,
        type: flat,
        size: 64
    }

or

    http://yourhost.com/getflag?type=flat&size=64&country=RU


If request was successful, API returns JSON with flag URL:

    {
        "url": "http://yourhost.com/flags/flat/64/RU.png"
    }

Otherwise it will return Error 400.
